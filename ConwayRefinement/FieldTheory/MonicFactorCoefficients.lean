# Coefficients of a monic factor over a relatively algebraically closed subfield

A monic divisor of a monic polynomial has coefficients integral over the base ring, because they
are symmetric functions of a subset of the roots. Over a field the integral elements are exactly
the algebraic ones, so if the base field is relatively algebraically closed in the coefficient
field then those coefficients already lie in the base field.
