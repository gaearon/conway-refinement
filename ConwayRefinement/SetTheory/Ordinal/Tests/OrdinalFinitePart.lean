# API checks for finite Cantor coefficients

The first two fixtures have constant Cantor coefficients five and seven. Their Hessenberg sum has
constant coefficient twelve; ordinary ordinal addition would instead discard the first constant
coefficient and produce seven. The first fixture is also checked directly against Mathlib's
Cantor-normal-form coefficient.

Finite removal is exercised away from both zero and the entire constant coefficient. The product
fixture has exact value `ω ^ 3 * 6`: it satisfies the proved `ω ^ 4` bound but is not below
`ω ^ 3`, distinguishing the required `p + q + 1` exponent from the nearby off-by-one bound.
