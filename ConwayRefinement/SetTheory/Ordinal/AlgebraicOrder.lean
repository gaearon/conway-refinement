# The algebraic order for Hessenberg addition

The algebraic order of a commutative monoid is `a ≼ b` when `a + c = b` for some `c`. Here the
operation is Hessenberg addition `⊕`, which is cancellative and strictly increasing in each
argument. Thus there is at most one `c` with `a ⊕ c = b`; when it exists, `b ⊖ a` denotes this
Hessenberg difference. Under the isomorphism
`(On, ⊕, ⊙) ≅ (ℕ[X_0, X_1, …], +, ·)` of [LM24, §2.2], `a ≼ b` exactly when each term in the
Cantor normal form of `a` occurs in that of `b` at least as often. This is not ordinal subtraction:
`ω ⊖ 1` is undefined although `1 + ω = ω`.

The relation is reflexive and transitive, preserved by `⊕` on both sides and cancellable, and it
holds part by part for the parts `b_{≥β}`, `b_{<β}` of `Split.lean`. The last section relates it
to the separation condition (n) of `Separation.lean`: if `c ≠ 0` has last term `ω^ε` in its Cantor
normal form, `b ⊕ c = h` and `h_{≥ε} ≤ τ`, then `b ⊕ θ < τ` for every `θ < c`.

/-! ### Windows for the separation condition

The bound `h_{≥ε} ≤ h_{≥β} ⊕ λ'` that `add_lt_of_lt_of_partGE_le` consumes splits into two cases
according to where the exponent `ε` of the last Cantor term sits relative to the cutoff `β`. Above
the cutoff the bound is monotonicity alone; below it the parts of `h` on either side of the cutoff
have to be compared with `λ'`, which the hypothesis relating them supplies.
-/

/-- **The window above the cutoff.** If the last Cantor term of a nonzero `c` has exponent at
least the cutoff -- which happens exactly when `c` has no part below the cutoff -- then the part of
any `h` at or above that exponent is bounded by its part at or above the cutoff. -/

/-! ### The windows at the two kinds of generator

A generator degree `c` complementary to a variable weight `w`, in the sense `c ⊕ w = α`, meets its
window in one of two ways. If the variable carries all of `α`'s part below the cutoff, then `c` has
none, and the window above the cutoff applies. Otherwise the window below the cutoff applies, and
what it needs is that the bound `λ'` agrees with the part of `h` below the cutoff at or above the
exponent -- which follows from the corresponding agreement one level up.
