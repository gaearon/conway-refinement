# Distinct-factor complexity checks

The fixture separates the intended first component from the tempting wrong version that
counts every occurrence: the number of factors grows from three to four, but distinct
relevant weights remain unchanged and the selected multiplicity falls. A second check removes
the selected member entirely. Both use only the compiled public selection API.
