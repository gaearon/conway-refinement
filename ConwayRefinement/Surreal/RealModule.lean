# Surreal numbers as an ordered real vector space

The standard ordered embedding of `ℝ` into the surreal field makes `Surreal` an algebra over
`ℝ`. Its scalar multiplication is ordinary multiplication by the embedded real, so it respects
the orders in both arguments.

These instances are natural candidates for CombinatorialGames. They live here rather than in the
pinned dependency so later surreal constructions can use real-linear Archimedean strata without
modifying the dependency revision.
