# The surreals fill cuts between small families

Between any two small families of surreals separated by the order there is a surreal, namely the
one born from those families as its option sets. This is the simplicity theorem in the form the
completeness criterion of `ConwayRefinement.Topology.Order.CoinitialComplete`
consumes, and it is restricted to *small* families for the reason that makes the restriction
essential rather than
technical: a surreal has a set of options, so no construction reaches across a family the size of
the ordinals.

That restriction is exactly why the surreals themselves are not Cauchy complete — the positive
surreals have no small coinitial family, so a Cauchy filter can outrun every small cut — and why
the route to a complete group runs through a quotient. `FillsCuts.of_surjective` carries the
conclusion below to such a quotient; supplying the small coinitial family there is separate work.

first below every member of the second are strictly separated by a surreal. -/

  (statement := /--
    Let $L,R\subseteq\mathbf{No}_u$ be small sets.  If $l<r$ for every
    $l\in L$ and $r\in R$, then there is $x\in\mathbf{No}_u$ such
    that
    \[
      l<x<r
    \]
    for every $l\in L$ and $r\in R$.
  -/)
  (proof := /--
    Form the surreal $\{L\mid R\}$.  The separation hypothesis makes this a
    valid Conway cut, and the simplicity theorem places it strictly above
    every left option and strictly below every right option.  Smallness keeps
    both option sets in the same universe.

/-- **A convex quotient of the surreals fills cuts.** The projection is monotone and reflects the
strict order, so cut filling descends from the surreals to the quotient — where, unlike in the
surreals themselves, a small coinitial family of positive elements can exist. -/

/-- **A convex quotient of the surreals with a small coinitial family is Cauchy complete.** All
three inputs of the completeness criterion are now in hand: cut filling descends from the simplicity
theorem, halving descends from division in the surreals, and the coinitial family is what the
quotient is taken to obtain.

The uniform structure is the one the order topology induces on the quotient; it is left as a
hypothesis so that no instance is imposed on `Surreal ⧸ H` here. -/
