# Small sets of surreals are discrete

No small family of positive surreals reaches down to zero: the surreal born between zero and the
family is positive and below all of it (`exists_pos_lt_of_small`). Every small set of surreals is
therefore discrete — around any point sits an interval meeting the set only there
(`exists_Ioo_inter_subset_singleton_of_small`).

This is why an analysis by limit points of a support has to be carried out over a small group of
exponents rather than over the surreals themselves. A surreal has a small support, so its support
has no limit points at all inside the surreals, and every rank computed there collapses. Over a
small exponent group the positive elements do have a small coinitial family, limit points exist,
and the analysis has content; the factorisations it produces are equations, and equations transfer
back along the embedding of exponents whatever the ranks do.
