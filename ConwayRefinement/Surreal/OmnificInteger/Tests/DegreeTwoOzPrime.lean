# API checks for the explicit degree-two prime

This separately compiled client consumes only the public standalone statement/proof boundary. It
checks the literal prime, the coefficient-doubled reducible foil, their exact common support order
type, and the support equality that makes the comparison mathematically sharp, in the surreal
numbers of an arbitrary universe.
