# A downstream client of finite-class omnific primality

Conway's one-row omnific integer has support order type `ω + 1`, so this client uses a genuinely
infinite support. Its reducedness supplies the finite support-class hypothesis. The stronger
prime theorem for this example is not used to obtain the primality conclusion here.
