# Degree of Conway normal forms in the full Hahn field

This module identifies the support order type used by LM24 with `ot(b)`, the order type of the
support of a Conway normal form `b` (the upstream `length`). The full Hahn exponent is
`Surrealᵒᵈ`, so its increasing support order is exactly the decreasing Conway-exponent order. The
only universe adjustment is the lift already recorded by `SurrealHahnSeries.type_support`.

Consequently, the surreal degree is the Cantor degree of the support order type of the full Hahn
image — the finite-degree paper's extension of LM24's degree to Conway's series, not a notion of
LM24 (Remark 3.4.4). It lies below `ω` exactly when the support order type of the normal form lies
below `ω ^ ω`, which is how the omnific-integer theorem states its hypothesis.
