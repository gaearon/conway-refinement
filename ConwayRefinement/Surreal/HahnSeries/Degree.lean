# Degree of a surreal Hahn series

The degree of a Conway normal form is the leading Cantor exponent of the order type of its
support. This is the finite-degree paper's own extension of LM24's degree from `K((ℝ^{≤0}))` to
Conway's series: LM24 names this map and declines it beyond `ℝ` (Remark 3.4.4), its own notion for
a general exponent group being the leading-class degree `deg_σ` (Corollary 8.1.4), to which the
transfer module relates it. It is therefore not a result of LM24 and does not live under
`ConwayRefinement/HahnSeries/Degree/`.

`SurrealHahnSeries` uses supports well-founded under `>`, because its exponent is the exponent of
`ω`, rather than the exponent of LM24's variable `t = ω⁻¹`. Its upstream `length` is therefore
the ordinary order type relevant to LM24 after this sign reversal. It also uses `Shrink` to place
the order type in `Ordinal.{u}`; `SurrealHahnSeries.type_support` identifies its lift with the
unrestricted order type of the support in `Ordinal.{u+1}`.

This file defines degree from that already validated order type. The explicit finite-support
theorem below checks that the universe lowering preserves the source's zero-degree convention.
