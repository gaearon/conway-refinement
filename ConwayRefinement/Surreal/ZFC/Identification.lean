# Native cut and normal-form criteria for the omnific-integer class

The class predicate defined using raw ZFC game codes is exactly fixedness under the class-valued
singleton Conway cut. Equivalently, its canonical Conway normal form has nonnegative support and
an integral constant coefficient. These are the cut and normal-form presentations of Conway's
omnific integers recalled in LM24, Section 1.1; the exponent orientation here is unsigned.
