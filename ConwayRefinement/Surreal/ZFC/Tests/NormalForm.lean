# A separate client of class-coded Conway normal forms

The chart and support-class predicates are used only through their public interfaces. The
normal form `ω + 2` separates reducedness from the incorrect variant that deletes exponent zero:
both its constant and its nonconstant term survive subtraction of one, in distinct Archimedean
classes. Zero is also tested separately, since nonzeroness is part of reducedness.
