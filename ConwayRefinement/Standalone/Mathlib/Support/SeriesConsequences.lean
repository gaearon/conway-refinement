# What follows from the primality of every series, in Mathlib's vocabulary

Every theorem below follows from the proposition `SeriesIsPrimal K` using Mathlib alone.

The consequences are the forms in which the theorem is used or quoted: `K((ℝ^{≤0}))` is
pre-Schreier (Mathlib's `DecompositionMonoid`); every irreducible series is prime; and any two
factorisations of a series into irreducibles agree up to order and units, the two multisets of
factors being related by association.
