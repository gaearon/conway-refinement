# Semantic checks for transfinite Cantor–Bendixson derivatives

In the order topology on extended naturals, stage one of the whole space is exactly infinity,
and stage two is empty. This separates derived set from closure and from a falsely discrete
ambient topology. The same calculation exercises a genuine limit stage. A two-to-one projection
also exercises the closed-map theorem without substituting injectivity for finite fibers.
