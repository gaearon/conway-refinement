# Completeness from a coinitial family and fillable cuts

An ordered abelian group need not be Cauchy complete, and the group of exponents of a Conway
normal form is a case in point: the partial sums of `∑_a ω^(-a)` over all ordinals `a` form a
Cauchy family with no limit, because a limit would need a support that is not a set. What rescues
the situation is passing to a quotient by a convex subgroup, where the positive elements acquire a
*set-indexed* coinitial family. This file records what that buys.

Suppose the positive elements of `G` admit a family `ε : ι → G` that is coinitial with room to
spare — below every positive element sits some `ε i` together with a second copy of itself — and
suppose every cut cut out by two `ι`-indexed families can be filled. Then `G` is Cauchy complete
(`completeSpace_of_coinitial_of_forall_exists_mem_cut`).

The proof is the usual centre-and-radius argument, carried out at the fixed index type `ι` so that
only cuts between two `ι`-indexed families are ever needed. Pick for each `i` a set `A i` in the
Cauchy filter of diameter below `ε i` and a point `a i` of it. Any two of these sets meet, so
`a i - ε i < a j + ε j` for all `i` and `j`; filling that cut gives a point `z` within `ε i` of
every `a i`, and then `A i` sits inside any interval around `z` of radius at least `ε i + ε i`.

For the intended application `ι` indexes a coinitial family of the quotient, the cuts are filled by
choosing representatives and taking a single surreal cut between the two resulting sets, and the
second copy of `ε i` is available because the quotient is divisible.

/-- **Cut filling passes to a quotient.** A surjection that preserves `≤` and reflects `<` carries
the property of filling `ι`-indexed cuts along with it: lift the two families to representatives,
which the reflected order still separates, fill the cut upstairs, and push the filler down.

For a quotient of an ordered group by a convex subgroup the hypotheses hold, so the quotient fills
cuts as soon as the group does — which for the surreals is the simplicity theorem at sets. -/

    Let $f\colon G\twoheadrightarrow C$ be a monotone surjection of preordered
    sets that reflects strict inequalities.  If every cut between two
    $I$-indexed families in $G$ can be filled, then the same is true in $C$.
  -/)
  (proof := /--
    Choose preimages in $G$ of the two families in $C$.  Reflection of strict
    inequalities keeps the lifted families separated.  Fill their cut in
    $G$, then apply $f$; monotonicity places the image between the two original
    families.

/-- **Completeness from a coinitial family and fillable cuts.** If the positive elements of `G`
admit a coinitial family `ε : ι → G` whose members each fit twice below any prescribed positive
element, and every cut between two `ι`-indexed families of `G` is filled, then `G` is Cauchy

Only cuts indexed by the same `ι` as the coinitial family are used, so for a quotient of the

    Let $G$ be an ordered abelian group whose order topology is induced by a
    compatible additive uniformity, and let $I$ be nonempty.  Suppose there
    are elements $\varepsilon_i>0$ such that, for every $c>0$, some $i\in I$
    satisfies
    \[
      \varepsilon_i+\varepsilon_i\le c.

    Suppose also that whenever $L_i<R_j$ for all $i,j\in I$, there is
    $z\in G$ with $L_i\le z\le R_j$ for all $i,j$.  Then $G$ is Cauchy
    complete.

  (proof := /--
    For a Cauchy filter and each $i$, choose a set of diameter less than
    $\varepsilon_i$ and a point $a_i$ in it.  Any two chosen sets meet, so
    \[
      a_i-\varepsilon_i<a_j+\varepsilon_j
    \]
    for all $i,j$.  Fill this cut by $z$.  Every point of the $i$-th chosen
    set then lies within $\varepsilon_i+\varepsilon_i$ of $z$.  Coinitiality
    of these doubled scales shows that the filter converges to $z$.
