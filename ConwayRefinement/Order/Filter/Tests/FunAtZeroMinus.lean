# API checks for functions at `0⁻`

A function that vanishes near zero represents `0` in `Fun_{0⁻}(ℚ)` even when it is globally
nonzero. A second fixture is eventually valued in a proper coordinate subspace but leaves it
away from zero. These distinguish eventual equality and membership from their global versions.
A nonzero constant function remains nonzero, and the tensor check evaluates the pointwise
representative formula on a nonconstant real-valued function at `0⁻`.
