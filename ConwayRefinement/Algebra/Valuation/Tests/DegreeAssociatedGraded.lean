# API checks for the associated graded ring of a degree function

The class of `X` in grade one is nonzero, and its homogeneous square is represented by `X ^ 2`
in grade two. The square is nonzero because its polynomial degree is exactly two. This checks
multiplication on a genuinely nonconstant representative and distinguishes the intended strict
lower filtration from a quotient that kills all positive-degree elements.

The zero polynomial still maps to zero in a positive component, checking the bottom-degree branch.
