# API checks for leading-grade valuations

A two-grade direct sum over `ℤ` verifies that leading grade uses the largest nonzero grade and
that ordinary addition of grades governs products. The asymmetric grades ensure that the client
is not merely checking the grade-zero ring inherited from the coefficient ring.

The first-projection valuation on `ℚ × ℚ`, read as a multiplicative max-additive degree, is
nonseparated, while its associated-graded valuation is separated. Its nonzero kernel element has
zero initial form, and a representative outside the kernel retains its degree under the
initial-form map. These certificates exercise the distinction between the original kernel and the
zero element of the associated graded ring.
