# API checks for max-additive degrees and associated graded rings

The raw constant-value fixture satisfies the two multiplicative semi-valuation axioms printed at
the start of LM24, Section 4, but the relation in Definition 4.1.1 is not reflexive. This verifies
that the additional zero-to-bottom condition used by the formalization is not a consequence of the
printed axioms.

The remaining fixtures are Mathlib valuations read as multiplicative max-additive degrees through
`MaxAddDegree.ofValuation`. The first is a nonseparated counterexample to representative-sensitive
quotient rules. It pulls the trivial valuation on `ℚ` back along the first projection
`ℚ × ℚ → ℚ`. Thus `(0, 1)` is a nonzero element of the kernel. The certificates verify that its
homogeneous class is zero and that `(1, 1)` and `(1, 0)` have the same nonzero class. These
statements would fail for a construction that collapsed only the literal zero representative.

The second fixture uses the separated trivial valuation on `ℚ`. It proves that the asymmetric
zero-plus-one test printed in LM24, Definition 4.2.4 selects the zero branch even though the class
of one is nonzero. Its grade-zero multiplication certificate also computes the product of the
homogeneous classes of two and three as the class of six. Together the fixtures exercise support,
separation, the strict quotient, and multiplication.
