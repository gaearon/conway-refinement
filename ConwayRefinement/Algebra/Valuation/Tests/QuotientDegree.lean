# API checks for least-representative quotient degree

The ordinary degree on `ℚ[X]` gives a separated max-additive degree. We quotient by `(X - 1)`.
The nonzero class of `X` also has the constant representative `1`, so its quotient degree is zero
rather than the degree one of `X`. Conversely, the zero class has the nonzero representative
`X - 1` of degree one but receives bottom degree. These two checks distinguish minimization over
all representatives and the explicit zero-class branch from the nearby wrong construction that
uses one arbitrarily chosen representative.
