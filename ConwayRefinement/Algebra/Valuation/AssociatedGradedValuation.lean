# The valuation on an associated graded ring

The largest nonzero grade of an associated-graded element is a max-additive degree on
`ν.AssociatedGraded` for every max-additive degree `ν`: products of homogeneous components land
in the sum grade, so the leading grade is submultiplicative. It is separated because direct-sum
support is finite, independently of whether `ν` is separated. For a multiplicative `ν`,
multiplication of nonzero homogeneous classes is nonzero, and the leading grade is multiplicative.

This is the valuation constructed in LM24, Definition 4.3.4 and Proposition 4.3.5. The degree of
an initial form is the degree of its representative, so iteration retains the original
homogeneous data.
