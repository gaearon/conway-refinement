# Values of the cofactors in the successor step

The successor step writes a relation as `F = ∑_t (∂F/∂X_t)(X_t + V_t)` with each `V_t` homogeneous
of degree `wt t` and free of the variables carrying the finite part. What it then needs is that
each `V_t` evaluates into the square of the ideal of positive degree.

The reason is that a monomial of degree `wt t` free of those variables cannot be a single variable:
if it were, that variable would carry the whole finite part, which the freeness forbids. So every
monomial splits into two factors of nonzero degree, and their product is decomposable.

Only two properties of the generators are used, that each sits in its own degree and that no degree
is zero, so they are taken directly rather than through a minimal-system structure.
