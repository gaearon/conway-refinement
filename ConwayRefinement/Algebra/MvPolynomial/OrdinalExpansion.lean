# Expansion in one variable, for ordinal degrees

The coefficient `xCoeff x k p` of `X x ^ k` in `p`
(`ConwayRefinement.Algebra.MvPolynomial.Expansion`) for a polynomial graded by ordinal
degrees `wt : σ → NatOrdinal`: homogeneity of the coefficients,
`xCoeff` of a product with a factor not involving `x`, `xCoeff` of `X x * p`, and the fact that a
polynomial of degree below `wt x` does not involve `x`.
