# Greatest common divisors in multivariate polynomial rings

A polynomial ring in an arbitrary type of variables over a normalized GCD domain is a GCD
domain. Each pair of polynomials uses only finitely many variables. Mathlib's univariate
polynomial GCD structure gives a GCD in that finite-variable ring. Splitting off the remaining
variables and applying `MvPolynomial.dvd_C_iff_exists` shows that the same element remains a GCD
in the full polynomial ring.

Gilmer and Parker (1974), Corollary 4.5 gives the classical result for an arbitrary GCD
coefficient domain. The theorem here assumes a normalized GCD structure, which is the form used
by Mathlib's univariate content theory and is sufficient for the finite-support Hahn-series ring.

The result is stated through `Nonempty (GCDMonoid R)` because `GCDMonoid` contains a choice of
greatest common divisors rather than a proposition alone.

    Let $R$ be a commutative domain admitting a normalized GCD structure, and
    let $I$ be any type. Then $R[X_i:i\in I]$ admits greatest common divisors.
  -/)
  (proof := /--
  A pair of polynomials involves only finitely many variables. Regard their
  finite-variable ring as an iterated univariate polynomial ring and choose a
  greatest common divisor there. View the full ring as the polynomial ring in
  the complementary variables over this finite-variable ring. If at least one
  of the original polynomials is non-zero, a common divisor of their constant
  images is associated to a constant polynomial; its coefficient divides both
  finite-variable polynomials and hence their greatest common divisor. The
  case where both polynomials vanish is immediate. Thus the finite-variable
  greatest common divisor remains one in the full polynomial ring.
