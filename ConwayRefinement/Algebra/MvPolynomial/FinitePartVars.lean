# Variables carrying the constant Cantor coefficient of a weighted degree

The coefficient of `1 = ω^0` in the Cantor normal form of the degree of a monomial is the sum of
the corresponding coefficients of the degrees of its variables. Thus, in a polynomial homogeneous
of degree `δ`, a variable whose degree has the same constant Cantor coefficient as `δ` carries that
coefficient on its own.

This module collects the elementary degree facts about those variables and the finite set
`varsOfFinitePart` that contains them.

None of it depends on where the variables are evaluated. Both the real-exponent argument and the
Cantor–Bendixson germ argument need these statements, so they are stated once here over an
arbitrary commutative ring.
