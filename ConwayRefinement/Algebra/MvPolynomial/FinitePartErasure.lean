# Erasing variables with a fixed constant Cantor coefficient

Setting `X_i` to zero whenever the coefficient of `1 = ω^0` in the Cantor normal form of its weight
is `k` defines the algebra map `eraseFinitePart wt k`. It preserves weighted homogeneity and its
image contains none of those variables.

Its defect from the identity is exactly the monomials the successor step needs to see. In a
monomial whose degree `δ` has positive constant Cantor coefficient `n`, a variable with constant
Cantor coefficient `n` occupies the whole coefficient on its own: it occurs to the first power,
and no other such variable occurs beside it. This gives the identity

`F' + ∑_i X_i ∂F/∂X_i = F`,

the sum over the variables of `F` carrying the finite part.

Nothing here depends on where the variables are evaluated, so both the real-exponent development
and the Cantor–Bendixson germ argument use it unchanged.

    Let $F$ be weighted homogeneous of degree $\delta$, and let $n>0$ be the
    coefficient of $1=\omega^0$ in the Cantor normal form of $\delta$. Then
    \[
      F_0+\sum_{\substack{i\in\operatorname{vars}(F)\\
          \operatorname{coeff}_{\omega^0}(\operatorname{wt}(i))=n}}
          X_i\,\frac{\partial F}{\partial X_i}=F,
    \]
    where $F_0$ is obtained by setting precisely those variables to zero.
  -/)
  (proof := /--
  Expand $F$ into monomials. If a monomial contains a variable whose weight has
  constant Cantor coefficient $n$, additivity of that coefficient under
  Hessenberg sum shows that the variable occurs exactly once and all other
  variable weights have constant Cantor coefficient zero. Otherwise the
  monomial is fixed by the substitution. Summing over the monomials gives the
  formula.
