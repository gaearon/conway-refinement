# Primality in a ring cut out by a residue condition

Let `L` be a field, `A` a commutative `L`-algebra that is a domain, and `π : A →ₐ[L] L` a
retraction of the structure map. For a subring `S ⊆ L`, the elements of `A` whose residue under
`π` lies in `S` form a subring `π ⁻¹ S`. This file decides when an element of that subring is
primal in it, in terms of primality of its residue in `S` and primality of the element in `A`.

The application is `𝐙 + 𝐊((𝐆^{<0}))`, which is exactly the preimage of `𝐙` under the
coefficient-at-zero map on `𝐊((𝐆^{≤0}))`; that map is a ring hom because `x + y = 0` with
`x, y ≤ 0` forces `x = y = 0`.

The statement is LM24, Lemma 9.2.1, and the proof follows theirs with two repairs the printed
argument needs. It concludes `e = f * g` from `b * e = b * (f * g)`, which requires cancellation,
so `A` is assumed to be a domain and `b = 0` is treated separately. And both left-to-right
directions invoke primality in `π ⁻¹ S` at a product whose quotient need not have residue in `S`:
at `π b ≠ 0` the residue can be `1 / π b`, and at `π b = 0` it can be any element of `Frac S`. In
each case a scalar is cleared before primality is invoked and undone afterwards. The rescaling
parameter `η` must also be chosen nonzero, in `L` for the first case and in `Frac S` for the
second.

    Fix $x\in L^\times$.  In $\pi^{-1}(S)$, primality of $p$ applied to
    \[
      (xp)(x^{-1}p)=p^2
    \]
    gives a factorisation $p=p_1p_2$ with $p_1\mid xp$ and
    $p_2\mid x^{-1}p$.  At least one of $\pi(p_1)$ and $\pi(p_2)$ is
    nonzero.  Cancelling $p$ from the corresponding divisibility equation
    expresses $x$ as a quotient of two nonzero residues of elements of
    $\pi^{-1}(S)$.  Both residues lie in $S$, so $x\in\operatorname{Frac}(S)$.
    The case $x=0$ is immediate.

quotient can have residue anywhere in `Frac S`; clearing a denominator first repairs it. Since a
