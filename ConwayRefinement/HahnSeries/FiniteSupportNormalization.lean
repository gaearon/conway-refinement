# Normalized finite-support Hahn series

A nonzero finite-support Hahn series is normalized when the coefficient at its greatest support
exponent is `1`. This is the normalization used in LM24, Notation 5.4.5. The definition uses the
intrinsic order-theoretic predicate `IsGreatest`; it does not choose a basis or identify the
greatest exponent with a real supremum.

Every nonzero finite-support series is associated to such a normalized series. Consequently every
associate class has a canonical, choice-defined normalized representative, with the zero class
represented by zero. Uniqueness is stated separately under the exact hypothesis that all units are
nonzero constant series.
