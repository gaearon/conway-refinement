# LM24 degree valuation statement

This module proves LM24, Theorem D with its printed quantifier domain: both input series are
nonzero. The ultrametric inequality and separation at zero are proved directly, while
multiplicativity uses LM24's reduction to Berarducci, Corollary 9.9.

The addition on degrees is Hessenberg addition transported to `NatOrdinal`, with an absorbing
bottom element for the zero series. The source's third clause is retained even though its fixed
input `b` is assumed nonzero. The stronger all-input separation theorem is
`HahnSeries.degree_eq_bot`.

  (proof := /--
  Decompose each nonzero series into a principal leading summand and a remainder
  of no larger degree. By
  \ref{fact:weakly-principal-order-type-multiplicativity}, the support order
  types of the two principal summands multiply. Together with the strict degree
  bounds for the remaining products, this shows that the leading term of
  $bc$ has degree $\deg(b)\mathbin\oplus\deg(c)$.  Hence
  $\deg(bc)=\deg(b)\mathbin\oplus\deg(c)$.  The zero cases follow from the
  ring laws.
