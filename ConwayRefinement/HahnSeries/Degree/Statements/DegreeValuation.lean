# Multiplicativity of the degree valuation in characteristic zero

Hahn-series degree on `K((ℝ^{≤0}))` is a max-additive degree over every coefficient field,
bundled as `degreeValuation K` from the submultiplicative bound of LM24, Corollary 3.1.2 alone.
Over a field of characteristic zero it is exactly multiplicative (LM24, Theorem D, proved as
`degree_mul`), so it is LM24's multiplicative valuation `deg`. This module
records Theorem D once, as the instance `(degreeValuation K).IsMultiplicative`; the degree-graded
ring `gr_deg K((ℝ^{≤0}))` therefore has no homogeneous zero divisors under `[CharZero K]`, and
every statement that needs exact degrees of products reads this instance.
