# Weak normal forms of Hahn series

This module formalizes LM24, Definitions 3.3.1 and 3.3.2, Proposition 3.3.4, and Corollary
3.3.5. A weakly principal Hahn series has positive additive-principal support order type. A weak
normal form is a finite lower-to-upper decomposition into weakly principal blocks whose support
order types are nonincreasing. The definition uses pairwise support separation; the
`isWeakNormalForm_iff_isChain` theorem proves that this is exactly the adjacent chain printed in
LM24 because every weakly principal block is nonzero.

The order-type condition is deliberately nonstrict. Repeated equal powers of `ω` represent finite
coefficients in Cantor normal form and must produce distinct consecutive blocks. The zero series
has the empty weak normal form.

The existence and uniqueness theorem is generalized from field coefficients and LM24's fixed
support-cardinality bound to additive-monoid coefficients and unrestricted Hahn series. Every
constructed block has support contained in the original support, so the construction restricts to
the source's bounded-support regime.
