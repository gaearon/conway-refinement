# API checks for the polynomial presentation of the series ring

The polynomial presentation `K((ℝ^{≤0})) = K_fin[b_i]` of the whole series ring over its subring
`K_fin = K(ℝ^{≤0})` of series with finite support [LM24, Not. 2.1.5], on the lifts `b_i` of a
minimal system of homogeneous generators of `P̂`, differs from the presentation
`S = K_fin[b_B : B ∈ 𝓑]` of the ring of series of finite degree in its scope: there every value
`F(b_𝓑)` has degree below `ω`, here every series, of whatever degree, is a value `F(b)`. The
checks record this separation, the two directions of the isomorphism on the variables, and that
the lifts are not scalars: `b_i` has the positive degree `wt i`, hence infinite support. The
factorisation consequences are recorded on an arbitrary series: every series is primal, and an
irreducible series is prime with no hypothesis on its degree or support.
