# API checks for greatest common divisors in the series ring

Pre-Schreier refinement alone does not provide a greatest common divisor for each pair. The first
check extracts exactly that stronger conclusion from the public GCD-domain theorem. The second
specializes it to `(0, a)` and checks both the zero boundary and the orientation of the universal
property: the chosen gcd is associated to `a`.
