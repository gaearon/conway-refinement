# Polynomial presentation of a germ ring

For a Cauchy-complete exponent group, a minimal homogeneous generating system for the
Cantor--Bendixson degree is algebraically independent. Representatives of the generators identify
the quotient by series bounded strictly below zero with a polynomial ring.

  (statement := /--
    Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero and let $G$ be a nontrivial,
    densely ordered abelian group with no least or greatest element and with
    no least nonzero Archimedean class in the magnitude order.  Assume that
    $G$ is Cauchy complete for its additive uniformity.  If $J$ is the ideal
    of series in $K((G^{\le 0}))$ whose support is bounded strictly below zero,
    then for some set $I$ there is a $K$-algebra isomorphism
    \[
      K[X_i:i\in I]\simeq K((G^{\le 0}))/J.
    \]

  (proof := /--
    Applying \ref{lem:extend-to-minimal-system} to the empty family gives a
    minimal homogeneous generating system of the associated graded ring of the
    Cantor--Bendixson degree.  Well-order the nonzero Archimedean classes and
    retain each class that is smaller in magnitude than every earlier class.
    The resulting family is coinitial in the magnitude order and well-founded
    when ordered by reverse magnitude.  Its groups $G_{\prec\sigma}$ therefore
    form a decreasing neighbourhood basis at zero.  Choose
    series representing the generators.  By
    \ref{thm:cantor-bendixson-minimal-generators-independent}, these generators
    are algebraically independent.  Minimality makes homogeneous evaluation
    surjective.  Evaluation at the representatives is therefore surjective
    modulo $J$, while its highest nonzero weighted-homogeneous component proves
    injectivity modulo $J$.
