# Archimedean classes met by a nonpositive Hahn support

The Archimedean-class order puts elements of smaller magnitude in higher classes. Consequently,
on nonpositive exponents the class map is monotone: moving an exponent toward zero moves its class
up. The Archimedean classes met by a well-founded nonpositive support are therefore well ordered
in the ascending class order.

This orientation is the one needed by the Conway induction. Restriction to the closed class ball at
`c` keeps classes at least `c`; its complement consists of classes strictly below `c`, a proper
initial segment when the support meets `c`.

    $\operatorname{supp}(y)$ is a class met by $\operatorname{supp}(x)$ and is

    The classes met by either nonpositive support are partially well ordered.
    Monotonicity of order type embeds the classes of $y$ into the initial
