# Multiplicativity of the support order type

Berarducci, Corollary 9.9, imported by LM24 as Fact 3.4.1: the support order type is
multiplicative for the Hessenberg product on series whose order types are additively principal.

The ordinal value is bounded above by the support order type, and on a series outside `J` whose
order type is additively principal the two agree: a representative modulo `J + K` shares a final
segment of the support, and a nonempty final segment of an additively principal order type has
the full order type. The order type of a product is bounded above by the Hessenberg product of
the order types, because the support of a product lies in the sumset of the supports. Theorem 9.7
supplies the matching lower bound, and the two squeeze.

  Translate each factor so that the supremum of its support is zero.  Translation
  preserves the three support order types and places both factors outside $J$.
  For a weakly principal series outside $J$, its support order type equals its
  ordinal value.  \ref{fact:ordinal-value-multiplicativity} gives the lower bound for
  the product, while containment of its support in the sum of the two supports
  gives the reverse bound.
