# The polynomiality of `P̂`

Let `K` be a field of characteristic `0` and `𝓑` a minimal system of homogeneous generators of
`P̂ = ⨁_α P_α`; in Lean the generators are `x i`, of degrees `wt i`. Evaluation
`K[X_B : B ∈ 𝓑] → P̂`, `X_B ↦ B`, is injective.

For real Hahn series, Berarducci's ordinal value is `omega` raised to the Cantor–Bendixson rank of
zero in the closed support. Thus LM24's Cantor degree is that rank, and `P̂` is
canonically the associated graded algebra of the Cantor–Bendixson degree. Its polynomiality is the
generic degree-induction theorem. The interval-based partial-derivative argument is the remaining
step specific to the real exponent group.

  (statement := /--
    Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero. If $(x_i)_{i\in I}$ is a
    minimal homogeneous generating system of $\widehat{\mathrm P}$, with
    $x_i\in\mathrm P_{w_i}$, then $(x_i)_{i\in I}$ is algebraically
    independent over $K$.
  -/)
  (proof := /--
  Choose principal series representatives $b_i$ of the $x_i$.
  By \ref{lem:principal-representatives-cantor-bendixson}, $(x_i)$ is a minimal
  homogeneous generating system of
  $\operatorname{gr}_{\delta_{\mathrm{CB}}}K((\mathbb R^{\le0}))$, and the
  same $b_i$ have the required degree and translated-truncation
  properties for the Cantor--Bendixson grading.

  Apply \ref{thm:cantor-bendixson-polynomiality}. Its two nontrivial relation
  hypotheses follow from \ref{lem:linear-occurrence} and
  \ref{lem:real-translated-truncation-partials}. Thus the
  transported family is algebraically independent. Injectivity of the graded
  isomorphism transports algebraic independence back to $(x_i)$ in
  $\widehat{\mathrm P}$.
