# The remainder estimate for pure powers

Berarducci's induction computes the value of a pure power `b ^ k` by applying Lemma 8.2 with
`c = 1`. That reading is not available: Definition 6.4 defines `v_J^p` only for value above one,
so the hypothesis `v_J^p(b) ≤ v_J^p(c)` of Lemma 8.2 is undefined at `c = 1`. Nor can the case be
absorbed by choosing some other factor for `c`, since the doubling in Lemma 9.5 then raises the
exponent of `b` instead of lowering it. The pure-power case is therefore developed on its own.

It is strictly easier than the general one. The term carrying the truncation of `c` disappears,
and with it the only use of that hypothesis. At a positive exponent the remainder for `b ^ (m + 1)`
is literally the two-factor remainder for the pair `(b, b)` one step down, so Lemma 7.7 transfers
with no new analysis; at exponent zero the remainder vanishes.
