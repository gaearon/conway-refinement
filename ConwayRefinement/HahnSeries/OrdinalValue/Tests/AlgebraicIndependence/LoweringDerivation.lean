# API checks for the quotient `P̂/I`

The quotient `P̂/I` satisfies two conclusions of different strength: the ideal `I` is prime,
equivalently `P̂/I` is a domain, and `P̂/I` is geometrically integral over `K`.

Geometric integrality is strictly stronger than integrality over `K`: tensoring with every field
extension must give a domain, with no finiteness or separability hypothesis.

The separate nontriviality statement matters because a quotient by the whole ring would satisfy
the no-zero-divisors condition vacuously, while `IsDomain` also requires `0 ≠ 1`.
