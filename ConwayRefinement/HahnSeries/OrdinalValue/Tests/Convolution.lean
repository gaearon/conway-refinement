# API checks for the convolution index

The index set of Berarducci's convolution formula is built from the closed supports of the two
factors, not from the supports themselves. These certificates exhibit a series whose closed
support strictly contains its support, and an exponent that the index set therefore contains
although it lies in neither support.
