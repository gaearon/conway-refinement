# API checks for the complexity of formal expressions

These certificates separate the complexity and its reduction step from three nearby wrong
readings: relevant values indexed with multiplicity rather than by distinct factors, a reduction
that carries the unselected factors over unchanged rather than doubling them, and one that deletes
the selected factor outright rather than lowering its exponent by one.
