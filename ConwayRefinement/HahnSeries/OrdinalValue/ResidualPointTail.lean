# Final tails of Berarducci residual points

For a cutoff `η`, `residualPointTail b η` is the final part of `X(b)` strictly above `η`.
Since every residual point is strictly negative, this is exactly `X(b) ∩ (η, 0)`.

The source phrase "sufficiently close to zero" is represented later by
`nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Iio 0)`. Its generic cutoff interface prevents a silent change of side or
inclusion of zero.

The remaining results isolate elementary consequences of well-ordering and least-upper-bound
hypotheses. They are the proved part of the interface needed to state and partially prove
Berarducci, Lemmas 6.8 and 6.9.
