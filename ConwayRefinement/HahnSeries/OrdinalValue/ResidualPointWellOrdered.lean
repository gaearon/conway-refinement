# Residual points form a well-ordered set

Berarducci, Remark 6.3: the translated truncation `b^{|γ}` lies in `J` unless `γ` belongs to the
order-topological closure of the support of `b`, so it is nonzero modulo `J` only for `γ` ranging
over a well-ordered set. Since a residual point has translated truncation of nonzero ordinal
value, the residual-point set is contained in that closure and is therefore partially well
ordered.

The two inputs are the vanishing of a germ outside the closed support, which is an elementary
metric argument, and the fact that the closure of a partially well-ordered set of reals is again
partially well ordered.
