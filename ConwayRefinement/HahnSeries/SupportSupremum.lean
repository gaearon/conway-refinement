# Supremum of the support of a nonpositive real Hahn series

For a Hahn series supported in `ℝ⁽≤0⁾`, `HahnSeries.Nonpositive.supportSup` is the
supremum from LM24, Definition 3.1.3. Its codomain is `WithBot ℝ`: the zero series has value
`⊥`, while a nonzero series has the ordinary real supremum of its nonempty, bounded support.
The least-upper-bound characterization certifies this semantic identification directly.

The addition and multiplication inequalities are LM24, Proposition 3.1.4. Normalization translates
a series by the negative of its real support supremum. A nonzero normalized series is again
nonpositive and has support supremum zero; this is the normalization used in the proof of LM24,
Proposition 3.3.7.

This operation is deliberately not extended to arbitrary real Hahn series. An unbounded support
has no value in `WithBot ℝ`, and LM24, Remark 3.3.9 uses precisely this obstruction to show that
arbitrary real Hahn series need not have normal forms.

The construction uses conditional completeness of the reals. Its public characterization and
monomial formula avoid exposing the underlying supremum calculation.
