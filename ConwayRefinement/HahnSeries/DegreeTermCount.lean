# Cantor term count of Hahn-series degree

LM24, Proposition 5.6.1 bounds the number of infinite-support irreducible factors by the
number of terms in the Cantor normal form of the degree. `HahnSeries.degreeCantorTermCount`
is that number, with value zero at the bottom degree of the zero series.

Under exact degree multiplicativity, this count is additive on products of nonzero series.
This is the numerical identity used by the factorisation induction.
