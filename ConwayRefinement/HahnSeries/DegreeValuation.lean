# The degree valuation on nonpositive real Hahn series

Hahn-series degree on `K((ℝ^{≤0}))` is a max-additive degree over every nontrivial coefficient
ring: the degree of a sum is at most the larger degree, and the degree of a product is at most
the Hessenberg sum of the degrees, because the support of a product lies in the sumset of the
supports and the order type of a sumset is at most the Hessenberg product of the order types
(`HahnSeries.degree_mul_le`, LM24, Corollary 3.1.2). The degree is separated: only `0` has
degree `⊥`.

Exact multiplicativity of the degree, LM24, Theorem D, holds over a field of characteristic zero;
it is recorded separately as an `IsMultiplicative` instance on `degreeValuation K` and is not
needed for the valuation itself.
