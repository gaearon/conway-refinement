# Reduced Hahn series

LM24, Definition 8.2.6 calls a nonzero series reduced when the intersection of its support with
the support after subtracting one lies in a single Archimedean class. We retain the zero class:
`ArchimedeanClass.mk 0 = ⊤`. This matters when the constant coefficient is neither zero nor one,
and distinguishes the printed definition from the incorrect variant that inspects only nonzero
exponents.
