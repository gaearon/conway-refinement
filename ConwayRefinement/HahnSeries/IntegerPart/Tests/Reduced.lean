# API checks for LM24 reducedness

The constant series `3` is reduced because the relevant intersection is supported only at zero.
The two-term series `2 + t⁻¹` is not reduced: both zero and `-1` occur in the support before and
after subtracting one, but zero and a nonzero exponent have different Archimedean classes. This is
the Hahn-series analogue of LM24, Example 8.2.7's non-reduced omnific integer `ω + 2`.
