# API checks for Archimedean-class truncations

In the Archimedean exponent group `ℚ`, the class of `-1` is the unique nonzero class. At that
class, `T` keeps the boundary monomial while `tau` removes it. This distinguishes LM24's weak and
strict class cuts; an ordinary exponent truncation at the representative `-1` would not provide
the same class-invariant interface.
