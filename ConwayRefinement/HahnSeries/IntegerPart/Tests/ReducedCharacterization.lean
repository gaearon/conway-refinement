# API checks for the leading-class characterization of reducedness

The boundary monomial `5t⁻¹` exercises the `tau = 0` branch. The series `1 + 5t⁻¹`
exercises the `tau = 1` branch. Both are nonconstant and reduced, so together they certify the
two alternatives in LM24, Proposition 8.2.5 `(4) ↔ (5)` through the public API.
