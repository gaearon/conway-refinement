# Finite-support Hahn series as an additive monoid algebra

Finite-support nonpositive Hahn series are canonically the additive monoid algebra on the monoid
of nonpositive exponents. The equivalence is defined without a choice of basis: its inverse sends
each formal monomial to the corresponding Hahn monomial, and its forward map reads coefficients.

This algebra equivalence is the multiplicative strengthening of `finiteSupportFinsuppEquiv`.
