# Primes of degree one

A series of degree one is prime exactly when it has no non-unit divisor with finite support.
Primality below degree `ω` makes such a series primal, and a factorisation into two non-units
would, by the degree formula, give one factor of degree zero, that is, of finite support; an
irreducible primal element is prime. Conversely a prime is irreducible, so in `b = p q` with `p`
of finite support one factor is a unit, and it is not `q`: that would force `deg b = deg p = 0`.

  (statement := /--
    Let $K$ be a field of characteristic $0$ and
    $b\in K((\mathbb R^{\le 0}))$ a series with $\deg(b)=1$.  Then $b$ is prime
    in $K((\mathbb R^{\le 0}))$ if and only if every divisor of $b$ with finite
    support is a unit.
  -/)
  (proof := /--
  Suppose first that $b$ is prime and write $b=pq$ with $p$ of finite support.
  Irreducibility makes $p$ or $q$ a unit.  If $q$ were a unit, multiplicativity
  of the degree would give $\deg(p)=1$, contradicting the finite support of $p$;
  hence $p$ is a unit.  Conversely, assume that every finite-support divisor of
  $b$ is a unit.  In a factorisation $b=cd$ into nonzero factors, degree
  multiplicativity gives $\deg(c)+\deg(d)=1$, so one factor has degree $0$ and
  therefore finite support.  The hypothesis makes that factor a unit, proving
  that $b$ is irreducible.  Every series is primal by
  \ref{thm:hahn-series-primality}, so $b$ is prime.
