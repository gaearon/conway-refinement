# Factorisation in the series ring

Let `K((ℝ^{≤0}))` be the series ring over a field `K` of characteristic zero and `K(ℝ^{≤0})` its
subring of series with finite support [LM24, Not. 2.1.5], written `K_fin` below. The polynomial
presentation identifies `K((ℝ^{≤0}))` with an arbitrary-variable polynomial ring over `K_fin`.
The GCD-domain structure established in `ConwayRefinement.HahnSeries.Primality.GCDMonoid` therefore
gives Mathlib's `DecompositionMonoid` structure on the series ring. Thus every series is primal,
every
irreducible series is prime, and factorisations into irreducibles are unique up to order and
units.
