# Greatest common divisors in the series ring

The polynomial presentation identifies `K((ℝ^{≤0}))` with an arbitrary-variable polynomial
ring over its finite-support subring `K_fin`. LM24, Fact 2.5.2 makes `K_fin` a GCD domain, and
the multivariate Gauss theorem in
`ConwayRefinement.Algebra.MvPolynomial.GCDMonoid` transfers greatest common divisors
to the polynomial ring. The presentation then transports them to the
series ring.

    Let $K$ be a field of characteristic $0$.  The ring
    $K((\mathbb R^{\le 0}))$ of generalised power series with nonpositive real
    exponents is a GCD domain.

  (proof := /--
    By \ref{lem:extend-to-minimal-system}, choose a minimal homogeneous generating
    system of $\widehat{\mathrm P}$ together with principal-series representatives
    of its generators. By \ref{thm:hahn-series-polynomial-algebra},
    $K((\mathbb R^{\le 0}))$ is a polynomial ring over the finite-support
    subring $K(\mathbb R^{\le 0})$. By \ref{fact:finite-support-hahn-gcd},
    the coefficient ring is a GCD domain. Normalising each nonzero greatest
    common divisor by the coefficient of $t^{\sup(p)}$ supplies the hypothesis
    required by \ref{lem:multivariate-polynomial-gcd}. Transport the
    resulting gcd operation across the isomorphism.
