# Unique factorisation under the LM17 support-order alternatives

L'Innocente--Mantova, Theorem 4.8 gives existence of irreducible factorisations for nonzero
series whose support order type is their ordinal value, or is their ordinal value plus one when
that value is greater than one. Polynomiality makes every irreducible series prime, so any two
such factorisations agree up to order and units. This proves LM17, Conjecture 1.6 without carrying
the paper's auxiliary predicate into the current API.

  (statement := /--
    Let $K$ be a field of characteristic $0$ and
    $a\in K((\mathbb R^{\le 0}))$ a non-zero series.  Suppose that
    $\operatorname{ot}(a)=v_J(a)$, or that $v_J(a)>1$ and
    $\operatorname{ot}(a)=v_J(a)+1$.  Then $a$ admits a factorisation into
    irreducibles, unique up to reordering and up to multiplication of the
    factors by non-zero elements of $K$.  These are the two alternatives of
    \cite[Definition~4.1]{LM17}.
  -/)
  (proof := /--
  Under either support-order hypothesis, \cite[Theorem~4.8]{LM17} gives a finite
  factorisation into irreducibles.  By
  \ref{cor:hahn-series-irreducible-is-prime}, every such irreducible is prime.
  Uniqueness of finite prime factorisations then shows that any two multisets of
  factors are related, after reordering, by association.
