# Finite-support Hahn series with constant term one

The multiplicative set written `1 + K(G^{< 0})` in LM24 consists intrinsically of the
finite-support nonpositive Hahn series whose coefficient at exponent zero is one. Packaging it
as a submonoid retains precisely the multiplication used in Sections 6.5 and 8.3, without
incorrectly giving it additive or unital-subring structure.
