# API checks for iterated Hahn series

This file checks the public ring equivalence on nested monomials. Both exponent coordinates are
nonzero and unequal. Their product appears at the coordinatewise sum in outer-then-inner order and
not at the swapped coordinate, separating the intended flattening from the nearest orientation
error.
