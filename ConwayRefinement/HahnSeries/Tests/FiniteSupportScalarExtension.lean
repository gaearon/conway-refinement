# API checks for finite-support coefficient extension

The integer fixture has nonzero coefficients at exponents `0` and `-1`. Its scalar extension to
the rationals retains both coefficients, so it rejects maps that preserve only constants, delete
the nonconstant term, or move its exponent. The rational fixture with coefficient `1 / 2` at
exponent `-1` is not in the image of integer scalar extension; this separates the exact
coefficientwise range from the full rational finite-support ring and from a support-only test.

The diagonal map `ℚ → ℚ × ℚ` supplies a separate scalar-recovery test. Multiplying the
extended nonzero fixture by the constant `(1, 0)` leaves the image, because that coefficient is
not diagonal. This exercises the step in Remark 6.3.5 which recovers a redistributed scalar from
one nonzero coefficient. An identity-map fixture then exercises the generic divisibility-reflection
reduction with an explicit scalar-redistribution witness.
