# A principal Hahn series approaching exponent zero

This module provides the shared nondegenerate fixture

```
∑ n : ℕ, t ^ (-1 / (n + 1)).
```

Its support has ordinary order type `ω`, is cofinal in zero, and does not contain zero. Thus its
support supremum is an unattained least upper bound, and the series is principal in the sense of
LM24. API-client modules use these proved properties to test normal forms, truncation bounds,
the negative-monomial ideal, and multiplicativity without duplicating the series.

This is shared example infrastructure for the checks, not part of the mathematical API.
