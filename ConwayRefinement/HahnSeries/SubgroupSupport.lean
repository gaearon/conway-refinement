# Series supported in a subgroup of the exponents

Splitting a series into the part supported in a subgroup `H` and the rest is compatible with
multiplication by a series supported in `H`, because `H` and its complement are separated by
translation: adding an element of `H` cannot move an exponent into `H` from outside it.

The consequence recorded here is that divisibility descends: if a series supported in `H` divides
another one in the whole ring, the quotient is again supported in `H`. This is the reason a
finitely generated subgroup of the exponents may be fixed once and for all when computing
divisors, and it replaces the free-module argument of Gilmer and Parker, Proposition 5.1 for the
purpose of comparing divisibility.
