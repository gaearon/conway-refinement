# Support order type and degree of a Hahn series

LM24 orders the support of a generalized power series by increasing exponent. Accordingly,
`HahnSeries.supportOrderType` is the ordinal type of the strict order `<` on the support; no order
reversal occurs in this module. For a linearly ordered exponent type, Mathlib's `IsPWO` support
condition is equivalent to the well-foundedness needed for this ordinal type.

If the exponent type belongs to `Type u`, the order type and degree belong to `Ordinal.{u}` and
`WithBot NatOrdinal.{u}`, independently of the universe of the coefficients. The degree uses
LM24's convention: a nonzero series has the leading Cantor exponent of its support order type,
whereas the zero series has degree `⊥`.

These definitions formalize LM24, Sections 1.2, 1.5, 2.2, and 3.1. Multiplicativity is a later
theorem and is not built into the definitions.

The support-decomposition theorems use the strict lower-to-upper relation
`HahnSeries.SupportBelow` and the generic support lemmas in
`ConwayRefinement.HahnSeries.SeparatedSupport`.
