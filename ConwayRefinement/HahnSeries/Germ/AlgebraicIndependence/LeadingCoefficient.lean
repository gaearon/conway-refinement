# Leading coefficients when the degree is a limit ordinal

The polynomial of each proper translated truncation is read through the finite convolution
formula. Its highest coefficient in a maximal variable is the polynomial of the corresponding
truncation of the leading coefficient. The uniform degree drop for the evaluated relation then
contradicts the degrees of sufficiently late translated truncations of that coefficient.

If the leading coefficient is a scalar, the coefficient one below the top instead combines with
the derivative contribution from the leading power. That branch is proved separately and joined
to the nonconstant branch here.

    Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero and $G$ a nontrivial complete
    ordered abelian group with compatible additive uniformity and order
    topology. Let $x_i$ be a minimal homogeneous generating system for the
    associated graded ring of the degree filtration, of weights $w_i$. Choose
    series $b_i$ representing $x_i$ such that
    \[
      \deg(b_i)\le w_i,
      \qquad \deg(b_i^{\vert y})<w_i\quad\text{for every }y<0.
    \]
    Assume
    evaluation at $x_i$ is injective on every homogeneous degree below
    $\alpha$.

    Let $F\in K[X_i:i\in I]$ be weighted homogeneous of degree $\alpha$ with
    $F(x)=0$. Choose a variable $X_{B_0}$ occurring in $F$, of maximal weight
    among its variables, and suppose $w_{B_0}<\alpha$. Write
    \[
      F=\sum_{k=0}^D H_kX_{B_0}^k,
      \qquad \Delta+D w_{B_0}=\alpha.
    \]
    If $\Delta=0$, or if the last Cantor term of $\Delta$ is at most the last
    Cantor term of $w_{B_0}$, then these hypotheses are inconsistent.
  -/)
  (proof := /--
  By \ref{thm:cantor-bendixson-value-multiplicative}, the
  Cantor--Bendixson degree defines the associated graded ring in which the
  weighted-homogeneous relation is evaluated.

  Suppose first that $\Delta\ne0$. Then $H_D\ne0$ is homogeneous of degree
  $\Delta<\alpha$. Injectivity below $\alpha$ shows that $H_D(x)\ne0$, so
  $H_D(b)$ has degree exactly $\Delta$. By \ref{lem:generate}, each proper
  translated truncation has a representing polynomial. Expanding $F$ in
  $X_{B_0}$ and using the finite convolution formula identifies the
  coefficient of $X_{B_0}^D$ in that polynomial with the polynomial
  representing the corresponding translated truncation of $H_D(b)$.

  Since $F(x)=0$, the translated truncations of $F(b)$ have their representing
  polynomials bounded in weighted degree by some $q<\alpha$. The hypothesis on
  the last Cantor terms and \ref{lem:natural-sum-approach} give
  $\rho<\Delta$ with $q\le\rho\oplus D w_{B_0}$. A sufficiently late
  translated truncation of $H_D(b)$ has degree $\rho$, so its representing
  polynomial has weighted degree $\rho$. Its contribution in degree
  $\rho\oplus D w_{B_0}$ contradicts the bound $q$.

  If $\Delta=0$, then $H_D$ is a nonzero scalar and $D\ge2$. The polynomial
  $H_{D-1}+D H_DX_{B_0}$ is nonzero and homogeneous of degree $w_{B_0}$.
  Injectivity below $\alpha$ makes its value at $b$ have that exact degree.
  The coefficient of $X_{B_0}^{D-1}$ in the translated-truncation polynomial
  is the polynomial representing its translated truncation, and the same
  argument gives the contradiction.
