# Finite convolution for translated Hahn truncations

In an ordered uniform exponent group that is Cauchy complete, the finite fiber of addition on the
closed supports indexes a local coefficient identity for a product. Translating weak truncations
turns this into a finite convolution identity with an error of Cantor–Bendixson value zero.
The indices use closed supports, including limit exponents where the actual coefficient is zero.

The coefficient argument reindexes finite antidiagonal sums. No infinite sum of germs or
commutation with an uncontrolled infinite sum is used. The hypotheses do not require density.

    Let $R$ be a ring, let $G$ be a nontrivial ordered abelian group equipped
    with a compatible additive uniformity and its order topology, and assume
    that $G$ is Cauchy complete.  Let $b,d\in R((G))$.  For $\gamma\in G$,
    let $F_\gamma$ be the
    finite addition fiber
    \[
      F_\gamma=

          \times\operatorname{cl}(\operatorname{supp}(d)):x+y=\gamma\}.

  (proof := /--
    Closed well-ordered supports have finite addition fibers.  In a
    neighbourhood of $\gamma$, each coefficient of $bd$ is the finite sum of
    the products of the corresponding truncations indexed by
    $F_\gamma$.  After translating $\gamma$ to $0$, the difference between
    the two displayed series vanishes on a neighbourhood of $0$.  By
    \ref{def:cantor-bendixson-value}, its value is zero, and adding it does
    not change the Cantor--Bendixson rank at $0$.  The two values are
    therefore equal.
