# Interpolation of translated truncations on a set

The construction places a prescribed homogeneous class at each point of an exact-rank set.
Nothing requires those points to come from a single series: the proof only uses that they are
partially well ordered, sit at or below zero, admit ordered disjoint left cuts, and are carried by
some derivative stage of a closed set at which the origin has already dropped out.

This file gives the interpolation theorem over such a set. The level of one series is one case;
finite unions of levels give the version needed for a family of prescriptions.

The one condition that is not merely structural is that the set be recovered from its closure near
zero: a point of the closure that is not in the set must not occur arbitrarily close to zero. For a
rank level that holds because the truncations eventually drop, and it is what stops the assembled
derivative from being nonzero away from the prescribed points.

/-- **Interpolation over a discrete set of centers.** A discrete set whose closure adds nothing
near zero carries its own derivative bookkeeping. Its accumulation points avoid a neighbourhood of
zero, so zero is not an accumulation point of them, and the second derivative stage of its closure
misses zero. Prescribed classes at its points therefore assemble with no further hypotheses. -/
