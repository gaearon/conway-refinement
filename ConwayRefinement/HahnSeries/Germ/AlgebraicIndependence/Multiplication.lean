# Upper bounds on Cantor–Bendixson values of Hahn products

In an ordered uniform exponent group that is Cauchy complete, every derivative point of a product
support lifts to a pair in the closed factor supports with a sufficient natural sum of ranks. For
nonpositive supports the only pair summing to zero is `(0, 0)`, giving submultiplicativity of the
value.
This is an upper bound only; coefficient cancellation is not excluded.

  (statement := /--
    Let $R$ be a semiring, not necessarily unital or associative, and let $G$
    be a nontrivial ordered abelian group equipped with a compatible additive
    uniformity and its order topology.  Assume that $G$ is Cauchy complete.  If
    $b,d\in R((G^{\le0}))$, then
    \[
      V_{\mathrm{CB}}(bd)
      \le V_{\mathrm{CB}}(b)\odot V_{\mathrm{CB}}(d),
    \]
    where $\odot$ is Hessenberg's natural product.
  -/)
  (proof := /--
    By \ref{def:cantor-bendixson-value}, the assertion is trivial if $0$ is
    outside the closed support of $bd$; otherwise its value is $\omega$ to
    the rank there.  The closed support of $bd$ is contained in the sum of
    the closed supports of $b$ and $d$.  By
    \ref{lem:cantor-bendixson-derivative-of-sum}, a point of rank $\alpha$ in
    this sum lifts to $x$ and $y$ whose ranks have natural sum at least
    $\alpha$.  Nonpositivity and $x+y=0$ force $x=y=0$.  Exponentiating the
    resulting rank inequality by $\omega$ turns natural sum into natural
    product and gives the bound.
