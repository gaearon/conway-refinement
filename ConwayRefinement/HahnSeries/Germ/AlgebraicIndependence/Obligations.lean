# Integration for the Cantor–Bendixson derivation

The polynomiality induction over an arbitrary filter takes the integration statements as
hypotheses, because the abstract lowering-derivation interface does not supply them. The
Cantor–Bendixson setting proves them by integrating prescribed homogeneous classes along cofinal
cutoffs, and this file matches those statements to the forms required by the induction.

The only work is the passage between a degree with positive finite part and its predecessor: the
induction states the hypothesis for a degree whose finite part is positive, and the
Cantor–Bendixson theorem states it for a successor.

  (statement := /--
    Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero, and let $G$ be a nontrivial
    ordered abelian group with compatible additive uniformity and order
    topology.  Assume that $G$ is Cauchy complete, and let $\nu$ be the
    Cantor--Bendixson degree on
    $K((G^{\le0}))$.  Let $(x_i)$ be a minimal homogeneous generating system
    of $\operatorname{gr}_\nu$, with weights $w_i$.  If the coefficient of
    $1=\omega^0$ in the Cantor normal form of $\delta$ is positive and
    homogeneous evaluation at $(x_i)$ is injective in every degree below
    $\delta$, then it is injective in degree $\delta$.
  -/)
  (proof := /--
    Suppose a nonzero weighted-homogeneous polynomial $F$ of degree $\delta$
    evaluates to zero.  The chain rule for the Cantor--Bendixson lowering
    derivation makes the derivative values of each relevant partial derivative
    pointwise combinations of the distinguished partial derivatives.  By
    \ref{lem:successor-ideal-membership-from-cantor-bendixson-derivative},
    these pointwise combinations give ideal membership. Then
    \ref{lem:weighted-euler-identity} places $F$ in that ideal.

    By \ref{lem:successor-relation-decomposition}, choose a
    finite family of relevant partial derivatives.  Their polynomial syzygies
    have a finite generating family by \ref{lem:syzygies-finite-variables}.
    Homogeneous ideal decomposition expresses every remaining partial
    derivative in the chosen family, producing a homogeneous coefficient tuple
    whose evaluation is a syzygy.
    \ref{lem:simultaneous-cantor-bendixson-derivative-representatives}
    supplies representatives that define a polynomial derivation.  By
    \ref{lem:polynomial-vector-field-lowers-degree}, it lowers the constant
    Cantor coefficient.  Apply the induction hypothesis to the resulting
    lower-degree syzygies, express them in the finite generating family, and
    choose homogeneous polynomial representatives by \ref{lem:generate}.
    This expresses the evaluated cofactor tuple as a combination of evaluated
    syzygies.  Consequently its linear part lies in the square of the
    positive-degree ideal, contradicting the defining independence of a
    minimal homogeneous generating system modulo that square.
