# Prescribing a derivative germ on a discrete set of exponents

The graded derivative of a class of successor degree is the germ of a function supported on the
exact-rank level of a representative. Conversely a function supported on any discrete set of
nonpositive exponents, with homogeneous values of one fixed degree, is such a germ.

This is the integration theorem for a discrete set of cutoffs, stated in the associated graded
ring rather than in one component, which is the form required by the syzygy induction.

/-- **A function supported on a discrete set is a derivative germ.** Prescribed homogeneous values
of degree `ρ` at the points of a discrete set of nonpositive exponents, whose closure adds nothing
near zero, are the graded derivative of a class of degree `ρ + 1`. -/

  (statement := /--
    Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero and $G$ a nontrivial complete
    ordered abelian group with compatible additive uniformity and order
    topology.  Write $\nu$ for the Cantor--Bendixson degree on
    $K((G^{\leq 0}))$.  Suppose $S\subseteq G^{\leq0}$ is partially well
    ordered and discrete, and that $\overline S\subseteq S$ on some left
    neighbourhood of $0$.  If every $a(\gamma)$ is homogeneous of degree
    $\rho$ in $\operatorname{gr}_\nu$, then there is a homogeneous
    $s\in\operatorname{gr}_\nu$ of degree $\rho+1$ whose
    Cantor--Bendixson derivative agrees near $0$ with
    \[
      \gamma\longmapsto
      \begin{cases}a(\gamma),&\gamma\in S,\\0,&\gamma\notin S.
      \end{cases}
    \]
  -/)
  (proof := /--
    Regard each prescribed value as an element of the degree-$\rho$
    component.  Discreteness supplies pairwise separated left intervals about
    the points of $S$.  Place a representative of $a(\gamma)$ in the interval
    ending at $\gamma$ and sum the resulting Hahn series.  Partial
    well-ordering makes the family summable.  Because the closure of $S$ adds
    no points near $0$, translated truncation at a point of $S$ recovers the
    prescribed class and gives zero elsewhere.  The resulting series has
    degree at most $\rho+1$, and its degree-$(\rho+1)$ class is the required
    $s$ by
    \ref{lem:cantor-bendixson-derivation-successor-formula}.
