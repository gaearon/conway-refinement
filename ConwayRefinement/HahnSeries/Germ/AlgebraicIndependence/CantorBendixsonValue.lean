# Cantor–Bendixson ranks of closed Hahn supports

The closed support is taken in the exponent type's given order topology. Its point ranks use
transfinite derived sets in that same topology, without passing to an order completion.

At exponent zero the associated ordinal value is zero if zero is outside the closed support,
and is `omega` to the point rank otherwise. In particular, a finite support has value one exactly
when its zero coefficient is nonzero, and value zero otherwise. These definitions impose no
multiplicativity assertion.

    Let $G$ be a linearly ordered set with zero and its order topology, let
    $R$ be a set with zero, and let $b\in R((G))$ be a generalised power
    series.  Write $C=\operatorname{cl}(\operatorname{supp}(b))$.  If
    $\operatorname{rk}_C(0)$ denotes the Cantor--Bendixson rank of $0$ in
    $C$, define
    \[
      V_{\mathrm{CB}}(b)=
      \begin{cases}
        \omega^{\operatorname{rk}_C(0)},&0\in C,\\
        0,&0\notin C.

  (proof := /--
    The closure of a well-ordered support is again well ordered, so its
    Cantor--Bendixson point rank is defined.  The displayed alternatives are
    the two branches of the definition.
