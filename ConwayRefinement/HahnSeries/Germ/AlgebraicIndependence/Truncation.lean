# Cantor–Bendixson ranks under translated truncation

A weak lower truncation preserves the closed support locally at its cutoff, since a well-ordered
support has a gap immediately to the right. Translation preserves point ranks. Consequently,
the value of the translated weak truncation at `c` reads the original point rank at `c`,
with value zero exactly when `c` is outside the original closed support.

The reconstruction statement lifts local lower bounds on exact-rank points to a lower bound
at the target point. Truncation uses `i ≤ c`, retaining the cutoff coefficient, and translation
by `-c` sends that exponent to zero. No multiplication identity is assumed.

  (proof := /--
    By \ref{def:cantor-bendixson-value}, the hypothesis on $b$ says that $0$
    has Cantor--Bendixson rank $a+r$ in its closed support.  At every nearby
    point of exact rank $a$, the translated-truncation hypothesis places that
    point in the $c$-th derivative of the closed support of $d$.
    Cantor--Bendixson
    reconstruction therefore places $0$ in its $(c+r)$-th derivative, which
    is the stated value bound.
