# Cantor–Bendixson rank levels of a closed support

The interpolation theorem over an arbitrary set of centers asks for five things. This file checks
them for the exact-rank level of a single series, so that the level version is recovered, and
records the two closure facts in the form a union of levels will use: the closure of a level is the
corresponding derivative stage, and near zero a point of that derivative whose truncations have
already dropped lies in the level itself.

  (statement := /--
    Let $G$ be a nontrivial ordered abelian group with compatible additive
    uniformity and order topology, and let $R$ be a characteristic-zero
    domain.  Assume that $G$ is Cauchy complete.  Write $\nu$ for the
    Cantor--Bendixson degree on
    $R((G^{\leq 0}))$.  For a series $q$ and an ordinal $\rho$, let
    \[
      L_\rho(q)=\{\gamma\in\overline{\operatorname{supp}(q)}:
        \operatorname{rk}_{\overline{\operatorname{supp}(q)}}(\gamma)=\rho\}.
    \]
    If $B$ is finite and $\nu(q_b)\leq\rho_b+1$ for every $b\in B$, then
    there is $\eta<0$ such that
    \[
      \bigcup_{b\in B}\bigl(L_{\rho_b}(q_b)\cap(\eta,0)\bigr)
    \]
    is discrete.
  -/)
  (proof := /--
    By \ref{thm:cantor-bendixson-value-multiplicative}, the Cantor--Bendixson
    degree is the multiplicative degree denoted by $\nu$.  Each exact-rank set
    is discrete.  Moreover, once the translated
    truncations of $q_b$ have degree at most $\rho_b$, the exact-rank set
    agrees locally with its closure.  Choose such a negative cutoff for each
    $b$ and take their maximum.  Above this common cutoff, each set has a
    neighbourhood disjoint from every other set at any point it does not
    contain.  The finite union is therefore discrete.
