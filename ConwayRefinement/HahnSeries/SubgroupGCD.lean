# Transferring least common multiples out of a subgroup of the exponents

Gilmer and Parker, Theorem 5.2 computes a least common multiple inside a finitely generated
subgroup of the exponents and observes that it stays one in the whole ring, because the ring is a
free module over the subring on coset representatives.

The same conclusion is reached here without modules. A common multiple is peeled one coset at a
time: multiplying by a factor supported in the subgroup commutes with restricting to a coset, so
each restriction is again a common multiple, and translating it back into the subgroup puts it in
the range of the hypothesis. The remaining part has strictly smaller support, which drives the
induction.
