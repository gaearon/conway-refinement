# Multiplication of normalized exponent-subgroup parts

LM24, Corollary 6.5.4 states that the normalized `H`-part of a product is the product of
the normalized `H`-parts. Its proof uses a specific Ritt-factorisation consequence: a normalized
`H`-divisor of a product of finite-support real series can be split into normalized `H`-divisors
of the two factors.

This module names that prerequisite explicitly and proves the complete reduction from it. The
prerequisite is neither installed as an instance nor folded into the definition of a normalized
`H`-part. Thus the intrinsic definition and uniqueness theorem remain independent of the later
Ritt and greatest-common-divisor proof.
