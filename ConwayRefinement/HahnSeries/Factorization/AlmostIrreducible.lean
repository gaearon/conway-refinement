# Almost-irreducible Hahn series

LM24, Section 6.5 weakens irreducibility for a divisible additive subgroup `H ⊆ ℝ`. A
series is almost irreducible when, in every factorisation, a nonmonomial factor forces the other
factor to be a monomial.

The three consequences surrounding LM24, Remark 6.5.1 are formalized explicitly. Irreducibility
implies almost irreducibility, and a strictly negative real support supremum prevents
irreducibility. The printed converse at support supremum zero omits the condition that the series
is not a unit: `1` is almost irreducible and has support supremum zero, but is not irreducible.
The corrected theorem below adds exactly that missing condition. The definition itself is not
changed, because monomials are intended to remain almost irreducible later in LM24.
