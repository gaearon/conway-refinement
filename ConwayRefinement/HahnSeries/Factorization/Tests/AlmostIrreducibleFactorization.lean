# API checks for exponent-subgroup factorisation

The scalar series `2` has a corrected factorisation with no almost irreducible factors. The same
series is not the unscaled product with normalized finite-support factor `1`, monomial exponent
`0`, and an empty factor list. This is the smallest boundary example that detects the coefficient
scalar missing from the printed formula in LM24, Theorem 6.5.7.
