# LM24 factorisation statement

This module gives the exact public signature of LM24, Proposition 5.6.1 for `K((ℝ^{≤ 0}))`.
A list represents the finite sequence `c₁, …, cₙ` from the paper, and its length is `n`. Every
list member is irreducible and has infinite support. The list length is bounded by the number of
terms in the uncompressed Cantor normal form of the degree.

The first theorem retains the derived fact that the coefficient scalar is nonzero. The second
theorem has exactly the conclusion printed in Proposition 5.6.1. Both retain the normalized
maximal finite-support divisor `p(b)` from LM24, Notation 5.5.2.

The proofs combine Berarducci multiplicativity, the finite-support greatest-common-divisor and
unit-classification theorems, Cantor-term arithmetic, residual reduction, and factorisation
induction.
