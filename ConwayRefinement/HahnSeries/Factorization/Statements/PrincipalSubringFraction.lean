# Relative algebraic closure in the principal graded fraction field

This module states LM24, Lemma 6.3.3: the coefficient field is relatively algebraically closed in
the fraction field of `P̂`. Equivalently, every element of `Frac(P̂)` that is
algebraic over `K` already belongs to the image of `K`. The coefficient field has characteristic
zero, which supplies the ordinal-value multiplicativity behind the ring structure on the intrinsic
ring `P̂`.

The proof reduces to the minimal-polynomial bound for a nonzero algebraic fraction, which is
established in the Berarducci development.
