# Divisibility in the degree-graded ring

This module formalizes LM24, Proposition 6.2.1, Corollaries 6.2.2--6.2.3, and Proposition
6.2.4. Degree RV is represented by the homogeneous classes in the associated graded ring. The
paper's set `P` of principal RV classes is represented intrinsically as the image of
`IsPrincipalRV` under the canonical RV embedding; `isPrincipalRVImage_iff` relates this exact
image predicate to homogeneous, componentwise-principal graded elements.

The published results retain the characteristic-zero hypothesis. Their divisibility arguments use
field-generic results about trailing grades, homogeneous divisibility, and the monoid-algebra
presentation of the principal graded subring.
