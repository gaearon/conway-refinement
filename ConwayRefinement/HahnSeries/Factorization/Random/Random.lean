# Random series

Fornasiero, Lavi, L'Innocente and Mantova, *Irreducibility in generalized power series* (2024),
Definition 1.3: a series `b = ∑ b_γ t^γ ∈ K((ℝ^{≤0}))` is *random* if the set
`cl(supp b) ∖ {0}` is `ℚ`-linearly independent in `ℝ`, or the family of coefficients
`⟨b_γ : γ ∈ supp b⟩` is algebraically independent over `ℚ`. Section 3 extends this to finitely
many series: `b_1, …, b_m` are *mutually random* if the closures of their supports meet pairwise
only in `{0}` and the union of the sets `cl(supp b_i) ∖ {0}` is `ℚ`-linearly independent, or
the joint family of all their coefficients is algebraically independent over `ℚ`.

The coefficient field has characteristic zero, so it is a `ℚ`-algebra through Mathlib's
`DivisionRing.toRatAlgebra`; algebraic independence is Mathlib's `AlgebraicIndependent ℚ`.
The two clauses are recorded as separate predicates, `IsSupportRandom` and
`IsCoefficientRandom`, and `IsRandom` is their disjunction, so that the theorems proved from
each clause can be stated for that clause alone.
